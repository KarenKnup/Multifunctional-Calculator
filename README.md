 <h2>:bulb: About</h2>
The idea for the <strong>Multifunctional Calculator</strong> came up during math classes, as I wanted to create a tool that facilitated certain calculations to help solve unanswered questions during my studies.<br><br>
During the project's development I chose the <strong>C language</strong>, as I was still in my first period and it was the first programming language I learned. Later I changed the project and used <strong>TAD</strong>, inspired by my Data Structure classes and focused on organizing and simplifying the code.
